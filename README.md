# Algorithms
Implementation of several data structures and algorithms in C++ and Python by me.

I am accustomed to go the easy way and use data structure and algorithms everywhere without thinking much about how it all works. Into this repository, I try to experiment with the implementation of my own data-types. My goal is to face challenges and think about how the Data Structure work internally.
